The in-person workshop, which occurred May 22-25, 2023 in Carolina, Puerto Rico, identified five-year breakthrough goals and annual objectives. Projects identified and prioritized in this workshop emphasized collaborative efforts of data collection that align with regional needs and education and outreach priorities for the local fishing communities. These projects, referred to as regional projects, are being addressed in working groups.

This project was a large undertaking and our successes would not have been possible without the collaboration of our regional partners including Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources [(DNER)](https://www.ecos.org/members/puerto-rico/), US Virgin Islands Division of Fish and Wildlife [(DFW)](https://dpnr.vi.gov/fish-and-wildlife/), Caribbean Fishery Management Council [(CFMC)](https://www.caribbeanfmc.com/), Scientific and Statistical Committee [(SSC)](https://www.caribbeanfmc.com/about-caribbean-fishery-management-council/scientific-and-statistical-committee), university researchers, National Park Service [(NPS)](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/oceans/caribbean.htm), Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies [(CIMAS)](https://cimas.earth.miami.edu/), NOAA Headquarters [(NOAA)](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/office-habitat-conservation), and Southeast Regional Office [(SERO)](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/southeast/sustainable-fisheries/sustainable-fisheries-caribbean).

A [NOAA Feature Story](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/improving-fisheries-and-ecosystem-data-collection-caribbean-through-partnership){:target="_blank"} was published in 2024 that highlights our collaborative successes.

**Five-Year Breakthrough Goals**

1. Expand the toolbox to inform fisheries management
2. Reduce gaps in datasets used to inform management
3. Improve communication of knowledge to better engage stakeholders in fisheries management process
4. Establish funding governance structures that are equitable for fishers, contractors, agencies, and islands and allow for the collection of necessary data gaps to inform fisheries management

**Regional Projests**

**1. Toolbox**

[Team Charter](assets/TC_Toolbox.pdf){:target="_blank"}

*Purpose* - to support the management bodies in the region by determining appropriate alternative methods and approaches to inform management with the available data, given that standard single-spp stock assessment approaches severely limit our ability to give advice for the very large number of managed species

*Deliverables*

**2. Fishery Dependent Data**

[Team Charter](assets/TC_FD.pdf){:target="_blank"} 

*Purpose* - to discover and inventory all known commercial and recreational fishery dependent data collections, including historical and ongoing, in the U.S. Caribbean as well as elsewhere in the Caribbean region for certain species and use the inventory to identify gaps for prioritization in terms of expansion or implementation of data collections critical to stock assessment improvement

*Deliverables*

<br>

**3. Fishery Independent Data**

[Team Charter](assets/TC_FI.pdf){:target="_blank"} 

*Purpose* - to describe the present data inventory for three survey targets: (1) reef fishes (0 - 450 m), (2) spiny lobster, and (3) queen conch, that includes associated temporal and spatial FI survey coverage gaps for fisheries management

*Deliverables*

> Project in progress. Check back for deliverables

<br>

**4. Life History Data**

[Team Charter](assets/TC_LifeHistory.pdf){:target="_blank"} 

*Purpose* - to identify and inventory all known life history data collections, including historical and ongoing, in Puerto Rico and the USVI and use the inventory to identify gaps for prioritization in terms of implementation of data collections critical to stock assessment improvement

*Deliverables*

> Project in progress. Check back for deliverables

<br>

**5. Habitat/Environmental Data**

[Team Charter](assets/TC_HabitatEnvironmental.pdf){:target="_blank"} 

*Purpose* - to identify the groups that are collecting data (available) and then the data that is needed for stock assessment, identify and inventory all known available habitat and environmental data sources in the US Caribbean, and use the inventory to identify gaps for prioritization of data collections critical to stock assessment improvement 

*Deliverables*

> Project in progress. Check back for deliverables

<br>

**6. Socioeconomic Data**

[Team Charter](assets/TC_Socioeconomic.pdf){:target="_blank"} 

*Purpose* - to identify major socio-economic data gaps and information to improve fisheries management decisions in the U.S. Caribbean

*Deliverables*

> [Socioeconomic Recommendations](assets/CSP_SocioeconomicRecommendations_2024.pdf){:target="_blank"}

<br>

**7. Communications**

[Team Charter](assets/TC_Communications.pdf){:target="_blank"} 

*Purpose* - to discover and inventory all known communication mechanisms and purposes between the commercial and recreational fishing communities and managers and organizations engaged in fisheries management in the US Caribbean

*Deliverables*

**8. Funding Governance**

[Team Charter](assets/TC_FundingGovernance.pdf){:target="_blank"} 

*Purpose* - to define needs and mechanisms for establishing a funding governance structure with the end goal of an informative, transparent funding framework to facilitate coordination of activities
