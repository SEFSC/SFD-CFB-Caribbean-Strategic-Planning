The in-person workshop, which occurred May 22-25, 2023 in Carolina, Puerto Rico, identified five-year breakthrough goals and annual objectives. Projects identified and prioritized in this workshop emphasized collaborative efforts of data collection that align with regional needs and education and outreach priorities for the local fishing communities. These projects, referred to as regional projects, are being addressed in working groups.

This project was a large undertaking and our successes would not have been possible without the collaboration of our regional partners including [Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources](https://www.ecos.org/members/puerto-rico/), [US Virgin Islands Division of Fish and Wildlife](https://dpnr.vi.gov/fish-and-wildlife/), [Caribbean Fishery Management Council](https://www.caribbeanfmc.com/), [Scientific and Statistical Committee](https://www.caribbeanfmc.com/about-caribbean-fishery-management-council/scientific-and-statistical-committee), university researchers, [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/oceans/caribbean.htm), [NOAA HQ](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/office-habitat-conservation), and [Southeast Regional Office](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/southeast/sustainable-fisheries/sustainable-fisheries-caribbean).

A [NOAA Feature Story](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/improving-fisheries-and-ecosystem-data-collection-caribbean-through-partnership){:target="_blank"} was published in 2024 that highlights our collaborative successes.

**Five-Year Breakthrough Goals**

1. Expand the toolbox to inform fisheries management
2. Reduce gaps in datasets used to inform management
3. Improve communication of knowledge to better engage stakeholders in fisheries management process
4. Establish funding governance structures that are equitable for fishers, contractors, agencies, and islands and allow for the collection of necessary data gaps to inform fisheries management
