The virtual workshop, which occurred May 16-18, 2022, established long and short-term goals and prioritized 39 actionable projects to be completed in working groups. These projects, referred to as local projects (LPs) relate to the focus strategies of: establishment or improvement of data collection programs, standardization of analytical data provision, operationalizing data automation, enhancement of internal and external communications, and addressing funding insecurities and EBFM needs.

**Long-term (Second-Level) Goals and Local Projects**

**1. Improve Data Collection Efforts**

a. Develop and implement fishery-dependent sampling and monitoring programs

> LP9. Develop the plan to identify funding and resources needed to develop and implement recreational data collection programs for spiny lobster and queen conch
> 
> LP10. Develop the plan to identify funding and resources needed to develop and implement a survey for commercial port sampling to be run by the territories with SEFSC support and guidance
> 
> LP6. Make Shellcatch data available and accessible
> 
> LP28. Identify mechanisms to better leverage stakeholder local knowledge
> 

<br>

b. Develop and implement fishery-independent surveys of priority species

> LP12. Develop the plan to identify funding and resources needed to develop synoptic fishery-independent surveys to estimate abundance indices and size compositions for all exploited reef fishes, spiny lobster, and conch

<br>

c. Develop and implement environmental mapping and oceanographic data collection programs

> LPXX. Organize a cooperative and coherent response to NOS request for survey recommendations
> 
> LP25. Identify funding to analyze the data
> 
> LP15. Identify those environmental data that are most promising to be informative for stock assessment and EBFM in the U.S. Caribbean

<br>

d. Develop and implement life history studies of priority species

> LP11. Develop the plan to identify funding and resources needed to develop and implement life history studies to obtain reliable information for all exploited reef fish species, spiny lobster, and conch
>
> LP32. Identify those genomics initiatives that are most promising for use in the U.S. Caribbean

<br>

**2. Accurately analyze data**

e. Operationalize Analytical Product Workflows

> LP20. Document best practices for reproducible, standardized workflows
>
> LP5. Identify regional data sources with emphasis on federal funding
>
> LP19. Strategically organize access to past internal work
>
> LP17. Perform gap analysis leveraging the Caribbean Research Inventory
>
> LP16. Prioritize among research gaps

<br>

f. Operationalize Assessment Workflows 

> LP18. Test and validate approaches to manage stocks using data-limited approaches
>
> LP36. Revisit and tailor SEDAR process to fit the needs of the Caribbean
>
> LP34. Conduct a collaborative data/assessment/management scoping with FishPath

<br>

g. Conduct well aligned research to produce informed assessment inputs and methods

> LP21. Identify the best practices for working openly and inclusively

<br>

**3. Efficiently manage and automate data**

h. Implement agile project management procedures

> LP1. Train staff in desired project management tool

<br>

i. Implement data automation procedures

> LP23. Collaborate between the SEFSC Sustainable Fisheries Division Caribbean Fisheries Branch and Data Analysis & Assessment Support Branch on standardized length composition
>
> LPXX. Review past data requests and develop roles and responsibilities between Alan's branch and CFB

<br>

**4. Enhance internal culture and communication**

j. Effectively manage staff resources

> LP13. Establish an effective coordination strategy among working groups, branches, divisions, other NMFS offices, and Caribbean partners
>
>LP4. Pass Center-wide strategic initiatives to relevant Center objective owners

<br>

k. Invest time and resources into strategic planning for working groups, branches, divisions, and other NMFS offices

> LP3. Year 2 strategic planning workshop to include SEFSC and regional partners

<br>

**5. Increase external collaboration and communication efforts**

l. Conduct collaborative science

> LPXX. Form interdisciplinary research teams who collaborate from data collection to model development and review.. taking what's been done for data flow diagram/Visio and modifying it to fit the Caribbean data flow and needs
>
> LP27. Integrate Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) in the research process
>
> LP33. Collaborate with local universities to collect data and provide projects for students

<br>

m. Develop external communications strategy

> LP14. Establish a protocol to have formal and informal communications with stakeholders in the language of their choice (e.g., Spanish translation)

<br>

n. Enhance education, communication, and outreach

> LP2. Create a portfolio of who we are and what projects we work on

<br>

**6. Incorporate Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management (EBFM) and socioeconomic impacts**

o. Develop a successful EBFM strategy that eliminates overfishing and overfished status on key species and considered the multispecies nature on fisheries

> LPXX. Develop a robust sampling program to obtain monthly price/lb data by species and island, and expenditure data per trip by fleet
>
> LP22. Complete the Caribbean Ecosystem Status Report
>
> LP30. Test stock assessment “alternatives” - e.g., management procedures, portfolio approach, to see if they can provide robust management advice
>
> LP26. Address the issue of subsistence fishing and its impact on the health of the fisheries (especially inshore areas)
>
> LP31. Establish an appropriate suite of existing fishery dependent indices to monitor key stocks, as well as ecosystem indicators and/or objectives

<br>

p. Build trust, rapport, and relationships with local stakeholder groups

> LP29. Integrate key socio-economic information to inform the management process

<br>

**7. Address funding insecurities**

q. Develop a structure to identify and coordinate projects to better leverage limited funding

> LP7. Identify internal sources of funding for US Caribbean stock assessment and EBFM
>
> LP24. Create back pocket plans -- we can expect emergencies or random funding so we should have plans in place to use these funds when they become available
>
> LP8. Match ongoing and planned projects and funding programs to link funding sources to projects
