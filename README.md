**Project Summary**

Regionally-specific and spatially extensive data deficiencies in U.S. Caribbean stocks significantly limit our ability to provide effective management advice. Crucial data limitations include reliable life history information, spatially and temporally extensive fishery-independent datasets, size and age composition, long term species-specific landings, and information on discards and bycatch. Other data issues include incomplete fisheries reporting, changes to reporting forms, a lack of local enforcement, and impact of market demands. Current practices for assessing U.S. Caribbean stocks involve catch-only methods, from which stock status cannot be determined. The only successful data-rich assessments of U.S. Caribbean stocks, in which management advice was provided, are the recent _Panulirus argus_ (Caribbean spiny lobster; Puerto Rico, St. Thomas/St. John, and St. Croix) and _Balistes vetula_ (queen triggerfish; Puerto Rico) assessments. Other commercial and recreational species important to the economy of the U.S. Caribbean region include _Aliger gigas_ (queen conch), _Ocyurus chrysurus_ (yellowtail snapper), _Epinephelus guttatus_ (red hind), and _Lachnolaimus maximus_ (hogfish), among others. Management advice obtained from the stock assessment process for such species is essential in order to effectively manage U.S. Caribbean fish stocks.

The project, “Developing a Strategic Plan for Fisheries Stock Assessment in the U.S. Caribbean Region,” was established by the Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) to perform collaborative exercises that will identify data collection strategies to provide the necessary inputs for the stock assessment process. The first step in this multi-year project was to produce a strategic plan for the SEFSC that prioritizes and coordinates data collection efforts including education and outreach and socioeconomic impacts. The principal investigators hosted a Hoshin Kanri strategic planning workshop (May 2022) with key SEFSC personnel involved in U.S. Caribbean data efforts in which the participants identified regionally-specific long- and short-term goals and produced a roadmap for accomplishing those goals in working groups. The second step was to produce a regional strategic plan that prioritizes and coordinates data collection efforts of key stakeholders and partner organizations. The PIs hosted another Hoshin Kanri workshop (May 2023) with key regional partners involved in U.S. Caribbean data efforts in which the participants identified additional annual objectives, projects, and goals to be accomplished in working groups.

This project was a large undertaking and our successes would not have been possible without the collaboration of our regional partners including Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources [(DNER)](https://www.ecos.org/members/puerto-rico/){:target="_blank"}, US Virgin Islands Division of Fish and Wildlife [(DFW)](https://dpnr.vi.gov/fish-and-wildlife/){:target="_blank"}, Caribbean Fishery Management Council [(CFMC)](https://www.caribbeanfmc.com/){:target="_blank"}, Scientific and Statistical Committee [(SSC)](https://www.caribbeanfmc.com/about-caribbean-fishery-management-council/scientific-and-statistical-committee){:target="_blank"}, university researchers, National Park Service [(NPS)](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/oceans/caribbean.htm){:target="_blank"}, Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies [(CIMAS)](https://cimas.earth.miami.edu/){:target="_blank"}, NOAA Headquarters [(NOAA)](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/office-habitat-conservation){:target="_blank"}, and Southeast Regional Office [(SERO)](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/southeast/sustainable-fisheries/sustainable-fisheries-caribbean){:target="_blank"}.

A [NOAA Feature Story](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/improving-fisheries-and-ecosystem-data-collection-caribbean-through-partnership){:target="_blank"} was published in 2024 that highlights our collaborative successes.
